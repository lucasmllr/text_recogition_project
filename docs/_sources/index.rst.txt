Document Recognition Project Documentation
========================================================
This is the documentation for the optical character recognition project hosted
on `GitHub <https://github.com/lucasmllr/text_recogition_project>`_. It was created as a student project. For details on the used
algorithms and results please refer to this :download:`report <report.pdf>`.
For an overview of the code structure see further below.

Code structure:
-----------------
The code is structured as follows:

At the top is the :doc:`pipeline.py <source/pipeline>` script whose
function read() takes as input an image, runs the segmentation, rotation and
classification algorithms on it and returns a list of strings as result.

:doc:`interface.py <source/interface>` provides a terminal interface for the read() function.

:doc:`arguments.py <source/arguments>` holds a class defining all parameters of the program.

:doc:`blob_extraction.py <source/blob_extraction>` contains the simple connected component analysis algorithm
to propose letter candidates.

:doc:`mser_extraction.py <source/mser_extraction>` is the more advances maximally stable extremal regions extractor
to propose letter candidates.

:doc:`components.py <source/components>` contains classes to store character candidates proposed by either
of the above two segmentation algorithms. All subsequent operations are done on
an object of the Components class.

:doc:`component_evaluation.py <source/component_evaluation>` contains functions to work on the Components class
including the heuristic filtering of character candidates.

:doc:`bbox_based_rot_correction.py <source/bbox_based_rot_correction>` is the faster, character-based rotation algorithm

:doc:`rot_correction.py <source/rot_correction>` is the slower pixel-based rotation algorithm.

:doc:`line_extraction.py <source/line_extraction>` is the projection based line segmentation algorithm that is
only used in combination with the pixel based rotation.

:doc:`model.py <source/model>` holds the architecture of the CNN used to classify character candidates.

:doc:`train_nn.py <source/train_nn>` contains functions to train and test the CNN for classification.

:doc:`data_gen.py <source/data_gen>` includes all methods to generate our artificial images.

:doc:`detect_iban.py <source/detect_iban>` contains methods to find an IBAN in a string.

:doc:`test.py <source/test>` runs the read() function on a directory containing jpgs and prints
extracted IBANs to the console.

:doc:`evaluation.ipynb <source/evaluation>` visualizes the proceeding of the full algorithm for an example
image.
